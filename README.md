Proposed Solution: Rob-Alert
Rob-Alert
is a hardware solution designed to prevent robberies by combining real-time monitoring and an integrated safety mechanism. The device can be installed in shops and will utilize advanced technologies to:
Technology Integration
1.
Limited Resources
: Police often lack the manpower or resources to constantly patrol high-risk areas.
2.
Response Time
: Robberies occur swiftly, making it diffi cult for authorities to intervene in time when they are not informed promptly.
1.
Monitor
: The device will constantly monitor the shop, using computer vision to detect any individual wielding a weapon (such as a gun or knife) and aiming at the shopkeeper or another person.
2.
Alert Authorities
: Upon detection, the system will immediately sound an alarm, and notify local police via an automated call or message. This alert will include live images from the scene and the shop's location details.
3.
Defensive Action
:
If the robber persists and poses an immediate danger to the shopkeeper, the system is equipped with a defensive mechanism (like a taser), which will be triggered with proper and prior approvals. This mechanism will only activate if the robber continues to threaten the shopkeeperâ€™s life.

To run this, you also need the weights file, but its size is too large to upload.
